* Users will be administrative types with varying degrees of computer knowledge. Therefore
  learnability should be important. Nothing too complicated. Possibly something with a 
  a mild skeuomorphic flair. 
  
* Memorability will probably not be too important. The software may be used in bursts     
 throughout the year, but it will be used very heavily on the occasions when it is used, 
  so memorability should not be an issue.
  
* The potential high volume of students should require high efficiency to make sure  
  workers can handle the student body on time.
  
* Errors should be a high priority metric since mistakes could cause some trouble for 
  students.
  
* Satisfaction is not high priority. It is not a "for fun" app, so I'm not going to go out
  of my way to make it super enjoyable. That said, it should be easy enough to use that 
  workers can get through the process without developing PTSD.
