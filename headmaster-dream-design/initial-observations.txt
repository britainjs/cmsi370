* Users will be administrative types with varying degrees of computer knowledge. Therefore
  learnability should be important. Nothing too complicated. Possibly something with a 
  a mild skeuomorphic flair. 
  
* Memorability will probably not be too important. The software may be used in bursts     
 throughout the year, but it will be used very heavily on the occasions when it is used, 
  so memorability should not be an issue.
  
* The potential high volume of students should require high efficiency to make sure  
  workers can handle the student body on time.
  
* Errors should be a high priority metric since mistakes could cause some trouble for 
  students.
  
* Satisfaction is not high priority. It is not a "for fun" app, so I'm not going to go out
  of my way to make it super enjoyable. That said, it should be easy enough to use that 
  workers can get through the process without developing PTSD.
  
* Will likely use menus, forms, and dialogues with a possibility of some small direct
  manipulation. The app is for managerial and administrative work, so the benefits of 
  using direct manipulation (which seems to be seen more often in "fun" apps) will not be
  as prevalent.
  
* Have a consistent search bar at the top of the screen to help find students and the 
  various functions of the app, similar to the OS X spotlight. Add an option to have the 
  search field function as an omnibox, like in Google Chrome, or to toggle between student
  and features. The consistency of the search bar is in line with Apple's Guideline of 
  consistency

* Have a consistent options button that will allow you to configure some basic options for
  your account on Headmaster, such as the functionality of the above mentioned search bar.
  Most likely will use a gear icon to represent the options button, since it seems to have
  become the universal symbol for options.
